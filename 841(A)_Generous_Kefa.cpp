s = "aabb" and k = 2:
After the first loop, freq is [2, 2, 0, ..., 0] (counts for 'a' and 'b' are 2, others are 0).
The second loop checks:
i = 0 ('a'): freq[0] = 2 (not greater than k = 2).
i = 1 ('b'): freq[1] = 2 (not greater than k = 2).
All other freq[i] are 0 (automatically â‰¤ k).
Since no freq[i] > k, the loop completes, and the program prints "YES".

Now consider s = "aacaab" and k = 3:
After the first loop, freq is [4, 2, 0, ..., 0] (count for 'a' is 4, 'b' is 2, others are 0).
The second loop checks:
i = 0 ('a'): freq[0] = 4 (greater than k = 3).
Immediately prints "NO" and exits.
